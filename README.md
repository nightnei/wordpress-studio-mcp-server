# WordPress Studio MCP Server
This project connects [WordPress Studio](https://developer.wordpress.com/studio/) with AI tools via the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**

It enables AI assistants (such as **Claude Desktop**) to:
* inspect local WordPress Studio sites and safely read project files
* manage preview sites (more actions will be added as they become available in the Studio CLI)
Everything runs **locally** and is powered by the official **Studio CLI**.

## Setup
To use this MCP server, you need the **WordPress Studio CLI** available on your machine.
1. Download and install **Studio**: https://developer.wordpress.com/studio/
2. Open **Studio**
3. Go to **Settings**
4. Open the **Preferences** tab
5. Enable the checkbox: **“Enable the studio command in the terminal”**

You can verify it works by running: `studio --version`

## Integrate with Claude Desktop
1. Build the MCP server: `npm run build`
2. Open **Claude Desktop** -> **Settings**
3. Go to **Developer** -> **Edit Config**
4. Add the MCP server entry:
```json
"wordpress-studio-mcp-server": {
	"command": "node",
	"args": [ "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/wordpress-studio-mcp-server/build/index.js" ]
}
```
5. Quit and reopen Claude Desktop

After restart, Claude will be able to use the Studio MCP tools.

## Development notes:
1. Inspector
	* When using the MCP Inspector together with `npm run build:watch`, click “Restart” in the Inspector UI after code changes.
	* File rebuilds happen automatically, but the MCP server process must be restarted.
2. Claude Desktop
	* When developing with `npm run build:watch`, you should quit and reopen Claude Desktop after code changes.
	* Restarting the connector alone may sometimes work (I encountered it a few times), but it is not reliable.
